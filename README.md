# audio-classifier
This project presents an overview on the sound classification concept that consist in
assigning a label to an unknown audio signal. This task is based on extracting relevant
features from audio signals and using them to identify to which class the sound most likely
belongs to.

For this aim, we first extracted Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features from a sound
data. After performing this step, we feed these features to a Convolutional Neural Network model (with Keras) to classify the audio signal into separate classes.
